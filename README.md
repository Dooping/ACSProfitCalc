## Personal Project for distributing profit from Ogame attacks

This was one of my first personal projects.

When my brother and I would play Ogame, we would attack other players together and would need to split the profit, subtracting spaceship losses.
Since I had just learnt the **Delphi** language for a university project, I decided to use it for this tool.

Since then I quit playing but still maintain the tool for the friends that need it, solving bugs that they point out.

The code is not well optimized, I may fix that in the future.
